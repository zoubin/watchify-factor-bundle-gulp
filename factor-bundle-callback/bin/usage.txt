usage: factor-bundle [ x.js -o bundle/x.js ... ] > bundle/common.js

Read `module-deps` json output from stdin, factoring each entry file out into
the corresponding output file (-o).

  -o FILE, -o CMD

    Write output to FILE or CMD. CMD is distinguished from FILE by the presence
    of one or more `>` or `|` characters. For example, use:
    
      factor-bundle browser/a.js browser/b.js \
        -o bundle/a.js -o bundle/b.js
    
    to write to a FILE. And do something like:

      factor-bundle browser/*.js \
        -o 'uglifyjs -cm | gzip > bundle/`basename $FILE`.gz'

    to use a CMD. In the CMD, $FILE is set to the corresponding input file path.

    If there is a trailing unpaired `-o`, that file will be used for the common
    bundle output. Otherwise, the final bundle is written to stdout.
